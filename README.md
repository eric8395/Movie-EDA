# An Exploratory Data Analysis on Movie Data

## The Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t know anything about creating movies. 

What is the demographic of successful movies and how well do they do in the box office? 

The goal is to explore the types of films that are currently doing the best in the box office and translate these findings into actionable insights for Microsoft's new movie studio. 

## The Dataset

Basic movie information data was collected from the IMDB database (www.imdb.com) and contains characcteristic information pertaining to movie release dates, genres, and IMDB ratings. 

Financial movie data was collected from 'The Numbers' (www.the-numbers.com) and has a comprehensive database of movie financial data. The data files provide movie release dates, production budgets, domestic and worldwide gross for movies. 

## Methods

This project involved cleaning the datasets for relevant information pertaining to success and popularity of a movie. Descriptive analysis, including visualizations of trends over time, are produced to provide further context on what makes a movie popular. These visualizations provide overview of historical movie demographics as well as commentary on recent movie box office success that can assist Microsoft Studios in developing future profitable movies.
